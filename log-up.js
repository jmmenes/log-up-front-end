// The code immediately above grabs the functions you'll
// need for this front-end code. Remember that you
// already have the back-end logic.
// (Check out main.js if you don't believe me!)

// Your job is just to make a user interface for it,
// getting the user's input from `getInput`, feeding it
// to the four back-end functions we're requiring in
// below, and then console.logging the right message.

// App Workflow:

// We'll be running our code as users by typing in
// `node [path to this file]` on the command line,
// followed by our email address and our password.
// (Or the email and pw we want to test!)
// We want to perform checks on that email and
// password to arrive at one of the following messages
// for the user:

// 1. If the email belongs to one of our registered
// users AND the password matches that user, tell them
// that they are logged in.

// 2. If the email belongs to one of our registered
// users but the password does not match that user,
// tell them their password is incorrect.

// 3. If the email does not belong to one of our
// registered users, and the email and password are
// both valid, tell them they're signed up.

// 4. If the email does not belong to one of our
// registered users, and the email is not valid,
// tell them their email is not valid. Preferably
// also tell them what makes a valid email.

// 5. If the email does not belong to one of our
// registered users, and the password is not valid,
// tell them their password is not valid. Preferably
// also tell them what makes a valid password.

// As long as given those inputs you get the right
// outputs, how your branching `if` logic works is
// up to you!

// Remember to test (using command-line calls to your
// app) each of those possibilities!

// You can and should use all four back-end functions
// from the first part of this assignment.

// Being sure to do all that's outlined above, write
// your code below!

const email = getInput(1);
const password = getInput(2);

// 1. If the email belongs to one of our registered
// users AND the password matches that user, tell them
// that they are logged in.

if (isRegisteredUser(email) && passwordMatches(email, password)) {
  console.log("You are logged in.");

// 2. If the email belongs to one of our registered
// users but the password does not match that user,
// tell them their password is incorrect.

if (isRegisteredUser(email) && !passwordMatches(email, password)) {
    console.log("Your password is incorrect.");

// 3. If the email does not belong to one of our
// registered users, and the email and password are
// both valid, tell them they're signed up.

if (isValidEmail(email) && isValidPassword(password)) {
  console.log("You are signed up.");
}

// 4. If the email does not belong to one of our
// registered users, and the email is not valid,
// tell them their email is not valid. Preferably
// also tell them what makes a valid email.

if (!isRegisteredUser(email) && !isValidEmail(email)) {
  console.log("Your email is not valid. Your email must end with @codeimmersives.com");
}

// registered users, and the password is not valid,
// tell them their password is not valid. Preferably
// also tell them what makes a valid password.
